For the manufacturing of the robot, the following components are used:
* 1x 7.4V rechargeable battery - in this case, micro-USB B type.
* 4x 1.2V rechargeable AA batteries (with holder and switch).
* 2x Voltage reducers (buck converters) - adjustable by potentiometer.
* 1x 2-pin switch - and another switch if one is not available in the battery holder.
* 1x 400-pin breadboard.
* 2x 170-pin breadboards.
* Dupont male-to-male, male-to-female, female-to-female cables.
* 1x Arduino Uno Rev3.
* 1x DC barrel jack (DC power jack) - to power the Uno Rev3.
* 1x L298N motor controller.
* 2x SG-90 Servos - to move the eyes horizontally and vertically.
* 2x ESP32-CAM - in this case, Ai-Thinker and M5Stack Wide, though both can be of the same model.
* 1x ESP32 (or ESP32-CAM without using the camera) - in this case, 1x Freenove ESP32-WROVER CAM Board.
* 2x OV2640 with 160-degree fisheye lenses.
* 1x 128x64 OLED SSD1306 I2C display.
* 1x KY-037 sound detection microphone.
* 1x INMP441 I2S microphone - for voice capture.
* 1x MAX98357A I2S amplifier.
* 1x 3W and 8Ω speaker.
* 2x 3-6V DC motors with gearbox - ending in copper, Dupont, or male JST.
* 2x DC Motor mounts, if the motors do not include them - to screw with 2 horizontal screws and 2 vertical screws each motor to the chassis.
* 2x Female JST to copper cables if the motors end in male JST.

Additionally, the following materials are necessary or recommended for the construction of the chassis, securing components, and manufacturing the eyes:
* 2x Wheels - 1x for each gearbox motor.
* 1x Free wheel of 3cm Ø.
* 1x Wooden or particle board of ≥40x40x0.3cm.
* 1x Wooden board of ≥~11x4x0.8cm - for vertical movement of eyes.
* Hexagonal M3 spacers of ~4cm in length.
* M3 screws of ~1.5cm in length, with head and double thread (without head).
* M3 washers.
* Normal and self-locking M3 nuts.
* 2 M2 screws - for the OLED SSD1306 I2C.
* 2 M2 nuts - for the OLED SSD1306 I2C.
* Ping pong balls.
* 1x Epoxy Resin Kit.
* Paints and brushes.
* Red thread.
* Blue Tack.
* Colored adhesive tape.
* Super Glue-3 - or similar.

Similarly, although not part of the robot, the following tools and accessories are recommended:
* 1x Digital multimeter.
* 1x 24 TPI steel saw or similar.
* Sandpapers.
* 1x Drill Kit - for size M3.
* 1x Soldering Kit - for INMP441 and MAX98357A.
* Pliers - and, potentially, wire strippers.
* Screwdrivers.
* 1x Clamp - to hold during cutting.
* 1x Measuring tape.
* 1x Scissors.
* 1x Printer - and paper- to print the iris of the eyes and the calibration pattern for the ESP32-CAM.

And finally, for the operation of the robot, the following are required:
* 1x Computer.
* 1x Router for internet access and/or phone with hotspot.
* 1x USB-A to Serial converter (to upload code to some ESP32-CAM models, such as Ai-Thinker) and/or USB-A to USB-C cable (for other models, such as M5Stack Wide).
* 1x USB A to USB B cable - to upload code to the Arduino Uno Rev3.
* 1x USB A to micro-USB B or similar cable - to charge the 7.4V battery.
* 1x AA battery charger.
