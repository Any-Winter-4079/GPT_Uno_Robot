Multi-modal language models can assist in identifying famous characters (present in the training data), but for the rest of the people (who will potentially be the robot's interlocutors and are rarely included in the training data), another method is required to collect new faces (i.e., save their images), learn about them (i.e., train a model), and correctly identify them when their face is recollected/captured again.

In this case, the incorporation of [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface), a framework that allows the permutation between various backends (for face detection) and models (for face recognition), is studied. In particular, it is decided to use 1054 images (250x250) belonging to the first 432 people (or all with names starting with ‘A’) from the [Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset) (from the total of +13k images and +5.7k people it provides), to compare the performance of OpenCV, SSD, MTCNN, RetinaFace, MediaPipe, YOLOv8, YuNet, and Fast MTCNN as backends (to identify the faces present in the image) and VGG-Face, FaceNet, FaceNet512, OpenFace, DeepID, and ArcFace as recognition models (to identify to whom those faces belong).

It is noteworthy that these models work by generating a representation or embedding of the images (so that new images can be compared with this representation through a similarity metric). Therefore, the speed at which these representations can be created is first studied. Figure 1 shows the number of images (or iterations) that each model can represent as an embedding per second (out of 1024 of the total 1054 images, keeping 30 for tests). As can be observed, DeepID and VGG-Face are - by far - the fastest models. However, once an embedding has been created for a set of images, it is not necessary to recalculate it to add new faces to the dataset of known images (only requiring the calculation of the embedding of new images), which is why all are considered acceptable.
