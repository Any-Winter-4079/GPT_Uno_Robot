## Connections
The robot's diagram includes the following considerations:

* Although the diagram shows 2 Ai-Thinker cameras, the actual robot uses 1 M5Stack Wide and 1 Ai-Thinker camera. Any model should be compatible.
* It may not be necessary to have 2 separate batteries (for example, a 7.4V and a 4.8V battery could be consolidated into one power source).
* The Arduino Uno's 3.3V output might be sufficient to eliminate the need for a second buck converter.
