For the manufacture of the eyes, a Ping Pong ball (per eye) is used as a mold, filling it with Epoxy resin. In the center, it is important to note that either Blue Tack (or another similar material, but noting that it should not adhere to the Epoxy resin, to facilitate its removal) is used to create a space (when the resin is removed) through which to introduce the OV2640 through the eye, or drilling the resin once it has dried - which is not recommended - will be necessary. Similarly, if a piece of Ping Pong ball is cut and glued (to prevent the resin from exiting the main mold) inversely to the main ball, a concave area can be created on which to place the iris, and improve the appearance of the eye. Figure 10 shows one of these molds, already filled with Epoxy resin. Note that, depending on the level chosen to fill the main ball with resin, the eye will be more or less rounded at its back - that is, it can create from almost a hemisphere to almost a complete sphere.

To paint the eyes, it is recommended to use white paint to cover the resin (transparent) and adhere several veins - created with thread - to it, joined with the paint itself, in this case white. After this, a gradient can be created, from red/pink to white, from the back to the front of the eye. Figure 11 shows the process of painting the eye and adhering veins to it, which are later (once the paint is dry) highlighted with red paint, potentially of different shades. Note how, in this case, the eye is a (nearly) hemisphere, whereas in the mold of Figure 10 (belonging to another attempt), the eye is (almost) a sphere.

Once the painting process is completed - and once dry - it is recommended to apply a thin layer of Epoxy resin to give a glossy appearance to the eye and, after that, the OV2640 can be introduced, filled with Blue Tack, and an iris - printed - placed on the front part. In Figure 12, two iterations of an eye design can be seen (spherical and hemispherical, and with more or less detail of veins). Ultimately, in this robot, the first manufactured eyes are used (see Figure 13), preferring a hemispherical design, only highlighting the veins on them a bit more. However, the more iterations are created, generally the better the result tends to be - see Figure 12.
